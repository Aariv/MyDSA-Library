# DSA From Scratch (Java)

This repository contains custom implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java. All LeetCode-style problems solved here use **my own implementations** of data structures instead of built-in Java collections.

## 💡 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in data structures by implementing them from scratch.
- Solve problems using self-built classes to understand underlying behavior.
- Avoid using `java.util.*` collections unless for comparison.

## 🧱 Implemented Data Structures

| Structure       | Status  |
|----------------|---------|
| Array          | ✅ Done |
| Linked List    | ✅ Done |
| Stack          | ✅ Done |
| Queue          | ✅ Done |
| HashMap        | ✅ Done |
| Binary Tree    | 🔜      |
| Heap           | ✅ Done |
| Trie           | 🔜      |
| Graph          | 🔜      |

## 📂 Structure
- `src/main/java/dsa/`: Contains all custom data structure implementations.
- `src/main/java/leetcode/`: Contains LeetCode problems solved using custom data structures.
- `src/test/java/`: Contains unit tests for data structures and algorithms.
- `src/main/resources/`: Contains any additional resources or configurations.

## 🛠️ Setup

- Java 11+
- Build with Maven or Gradle (optional)

## 🚀 How to Contribute
